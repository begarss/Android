    <string name="first">â€œDonâ€™t be afraid of strangers, dear.

Beware of your loved ones.

You give them your heart, your soul.

They can either mend you or break you.

You give them your weakness, they become your strength.

Donâ€™t fall for the wrong person.

Because when they hurt you, it will

bring you pain a wave of sorrow drowning you.

You would be stuck in the middle dangling in between their love and pain.

Moving on will become so hard, dear.

Choose your man wisely.

I remember her words

I remember my mother last words.

Those words, those memories rollled down my cheeks.

Creating a chaos of salt and dust.

    <string name="second">If Iâ€™m looked at as a lamb,

Then let me roam among the valley alone.

Iâ€™ve loved many lions,

Iâ€™ve been startled by many bears,

Iâ€™ve stood against many wolves,

Every last one of them taught me something:

To think fast,

Keep a watchful eye,

And trust very few if not anyone.</string>
    <string name="third">Our world is angry

But love leads to change

So try it and see.

    <string name="fo">I think of all the things I could say.....

And the way I should explain...

This is not just a joke to me...

Every single side of me that I show....

I play with caution.....

Not that Iâ€™m not a plain sheet....

But the act has to be worthy....

Worthy enough to toil your mind...

They shine because of you

They shine like you do

In natures church.

They are your congregation,

Worship with them.

    <string name="seven" >Being Strong Alone means :-

Crying aloud and wiping your tears,

Accepting yourself with all flaws and fears.

Being Strong Alone means:-

Accepting that alone youre weak,

Knowing that someones help you seek.

Being Strong Alone means:-

Realising that youre not fine,

Instead of that you shine,

Being Strong Alone means:-

Accepting that youve a scar,

Your life is like field of war.

Being Strong Alone means:-

Forgiving yourself for your sins,

Spreading light where darkness reigns.

Being Strong Alone means:-

Realising that youre alone,

Remembering that youre made up of wax not of stone.

        I looked into your eyes

And felt the pain within your plea

And knew the truth that you spoke

Would never get to me

Even when you give your heart

And even when you cry

The truth is so much harder

Than to tell a simple lie

To say that someday everything

Will make everything okay

To say that you love me

If fair enough reason for you to stay

Ill give you the sea

The skys joyous song

If your love can help-

Me feel that I belong.

        She is Subtle in this Loud World

"A Glorious Mess she is"

In the World Full of People,

She Hides and Lives in Imagination

What She Creates was Chaos

Wanders in Riddles end up in

Middle of Nowhere

"A Gorgeous Mystery she is"

Her Heart was Gold

Her Smile was Bold

Glitter running through her Veins

She Gleams like a Supernova

 in the Skies of pain</string>
    <string name="ten" >

        Struggling to find the perfect shade of foundation,

She is doing this in isolation,

Trying to find the best concealer,

She wants to look killer,

She is not doing this to impress someone,

She doesnt want to look different from everyone,

Confused between the hundred colours of lipstick,

She dont want anyone to call her rustic,

Perfecting the shape of eyeliner,

She is trying to find the best primer,

She is doing this to save herself from peoples taunts,

To hide her Wheatish complexion is all she wants,

No one notices her soul,

A beautiful face is their ultimate goal,

I hope in doing her makeover shell succeed,

But she also knows that to look beauty not makeup but to open up her hair is all she need.
